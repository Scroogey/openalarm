# Features
This is an advanced, open source alarm app.

**Alarms**
- adjust next ring time (e.g. tomorrow you have no class the first period: add 45min only to your next alarm)
- skip alarms for one day or until a specific date (useful for holidays)
- settings: ringtone, vibrate, Time announcement via TTS (custom TTS supported), days of week to ring, ring once, self destroy after stopping, custom ringtone volume, fade-in
- alarm snooze: enable/disable, set how often it is allowed to snooze, change default snooze time, set snooze presets (3), custom timeout
- Two ringing screens: Clean (with joystick like control) and Easy (with simple buttons)
- label/name for alarms

**Groups**
- add as many alarms as you wish
- control all alarms in the group at once (adjust next ring time, enable/disable, skip)
- cleaner main screen

**Timers**
- two presets to add time to a running or ringing timer
- stop or add time via notification

# Disclaimer
This project has been developed with the help of AI, mainly Google's Gemini 3 Pro Preview in AIStudio and Gemini 3 Flash in Antigravity but also ChatGPT, Mistral and Claude, and this is my first real coding project. 
So be **careful** when using this alarm app.
If you miss an important meeting and loose 110k$ it is your own fault for relying on only this app to wake you up.
I of course try my best to make this app reliable, but things differ from device to device and sometimes there's bugs that aren't so easy to find.
If you experience any issues or find any bugs, please file an issue on github or write me an e-mail: [app@laurik.de](mailto:app@laurik.de).
